1. In a bustling chocolate factory, workers are busy packing chocolates into packets. Each packet is represented by an array of integers, where `0` signifies an empty packet. The factory manager has tasked you with finding all the empty packets and pushing them to the end of the array.
Example

Input
N = 8
arr = [4, 5, 0, 1, 9, 0, 5, 0]
Output
4 5 1 9 5 0 0 0

#include <iostream>
#include<vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n,i=0,val,cnt=0;
    cin>>n;
   vector<int>A(n,0);
   
   while(i<n)
   {
       cin>>val;
       if(val!=0){
           A[cnt++]=val;
           
       }
       i++;
   }
   for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
   {
       cout<<A[i]<<" ";
   }
    
    
    
    return 0;
}
