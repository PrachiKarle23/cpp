TCS NQT Coding Question 2023 – September Day 1 – Slot 1
Problem Statement – Given a string S(input consisting) of ‘*’ and ‘#’. The length of the string is variable. The task is to find the minimum number of ‘*’ or ‘#’ to make it a valid string. The string is considered valid if the number of ‘*’ and ‘#’ are equal. The ‘*’ and ‘#’ can be at any position in the string.
Note : The output will be a positive or negative integer based on number of ‘*’ and ‘#’ in the input string.

(*>#): positive integer
(#>*): negative integer
(#=*): 0
Example 1:
Input 1:

###***   -> Value of S
Output :

0   → number of * and # are equal


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   string s;
   cin>>s;
   int b=0,a=0;
   for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
   {
        if(s[i]=='*'){
            b++;
        }
        else if(s[i]=='#'){
            a++;
        }
   }
   cout<<b-a<<endl;

    return 0;
}
